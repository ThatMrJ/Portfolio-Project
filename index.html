        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Hi my name is Sililo, a soon to be New Zealand programmer. I developed
            an interest in this career after watching my friend develop his own
            software to achieve automation in personal daily activities, the
            ability to create programs to execute a task for me brought me to
            wanting to pursue the skills myself.</p>
        
        <p>I spent a small amount of time on an udemy course teaching me the basics 
            of python where I decided to further this interest and found the course 
            provider Learning People, who alongside CodeCademy helped me to learn the 
            basics of web development and the languages that were included such as 
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript and supporting programs like Git.</p>
